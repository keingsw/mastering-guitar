## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Core Design Decisions
1. **Theory-First Learning**: Analytical approach over muscle memory
2. **Sequential Audio**: Root→3rd→5th→Harmony playback pattern  
3. **Progressive Difficulty**: 10-level adaptive system (beginner to expert)
4. **Mobile-First Responsive**: Same UX across all devices
5. **Accessibility-First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with multiple interaction modes

### Visual System
- **Color Coding**: Red (Root), Yellow (3rd), Blue (5th) with accessibility alternatives
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy supporting educational content
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile accessibility
- **Responsive Layouts**: Adaptive interfaces for all screen sizes
