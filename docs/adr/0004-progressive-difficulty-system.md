# ADR-0004: Progressive Difficulty System

**Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team, UX Designer, Educational Consultant  

## Context

The application needs to support learners from complete beginners to advanced players. A system is needed to provide appropriate challenge levels while maintaining engagement and preventing frustration or boredom.

## Decision

We will implement a **10-level adaptive progressive difficulty system** that scales from basic major triads to advanced jazz theory concepts.

### Level Structure:
```
Levels 1-2 (Foundation): Major triads, root position, visual recognition
Levels 3-4 (Expansion): Minor triads, multiple positions, audio identification  
Levels 5-6 (Application): Diminished/augmented, progressions, construction
Levels 7-8 (Mastery): All keys/types, speed challenges, complex progressions
Levels 9-10 (Expert): Jazz progressions, modal theory, real-time performance
```

### Adaptive Algorithm:
- **Advancement**: 80%+ accuracy over 10 consecutive attempts
- **Remedial Practice**: <60% accuracy triggers review mode
- **Speed Bonuses**: Time-based scoring for quick recognition
- **Plateau Detection**: Extended time at level triggers alternative approaches

## Rationale

### Why 10-Level System:
- **User Requirement**: Explicitly requested beginner-to-advanced progression
- **Psychological Motivation**: Clear progress milestones increase engagement
- **Educational Scaffolding**: Each level builds on previous concepts
- **Granular Control**: Allows fine-tuned difficulty adjustments

### Why Adaptive Scoring:
- **Personalized Learning**: Adjusts to individual learning pace
- **Prevents Frustration**: Doesn't advance unprepared students
- **Maintains Challenge**: Prevents boredom from too-easy content
- **Data-Driven**: Performance metrics guide progression decisions

### Curriculum Design Principles:
- **Spiral Learning**: Revisit concepts with increasing complexity
- **Theory Integration**: Each level adds theoretical depth
- **Practical Application**: Connect theory to real musical contexts
- **Multiple Learning Modalities**: Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements

## Implementation Strategy

### Level Progression Details:

**Levels 1-2 (Foundation)**
- Content: C, G, D major triads only
- Skills: Visual fretboard recognition, basic intervals
- Assessment: Static visual identification
- Theory: Root, 3rd, 5th concept introduction

**Levels 3-4 (Expansion)**  
- Content: All natural key major/minor triads (C, D, E, F, G, A, B)
- Skills: Audio-only identification, multiple fretboard positions
- Assessment: Mixed audio/visual challenges
- Theory: Major vs minor quality, scale degree relationships

**Levels 5-6 (Application)**
- Content: Diminished, augmented triads, sharp/flat keys
- Skills: Chord construction, simple progressions (I-vi-IV-V)
- Assessment: Build-on-fretboard exercises, progression recognition
- Theory: Chord function, harmonic analysis basics

**Levels 7-8 (Mastery)**
- Content: All 12 keys, all triad types, complex progressions
- Skills: Speed recognition, harmonic analysis, voice leading
- Assessment: Timed challenges, progression analysis
- Theory: Roman numeral analysis, secondary dominants

**Levels 9-10 (Expert)**
- Content: Jazz progressions, modal concepts, extended harmony
- Skills: Real-time performance, improvisation preparation
- Assessment: Performance-based evaluation, creative exercises
- Theory: Modal interchange, advanced voice leading, jazz harmony

### Adaptive Mechanics:
- **Performance Tracking**: Rolling average of last 20 attempts
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical significance for advancement
- **Multiple Skill Tracking**: Separate progress for recognition, construction, theory
- **Plateau Intervention**: Alternative exercises when progress stalls

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Fixed Linear Progression**
   - Simpler to implement, predictable advancement
   - Rejected: Doesn't accommodate individual learning differences
   - Could frustrate fast learners or overwhelm slower ones

2. **User-Selected Difficulty**
   - Complete user control over challenge level
   - Rejected: Users often choose inappropriately (too easy/hard)
   - Reduces educational effectiveness

3. **Skill-Based Branching**
   - Separate tracks for different musical skills
   - Rejected: Overly complex for triad-focused application
   - Would fragment learning experience

4. **Time-Based Progression**
   - Advance after spending time at each level
   - Rejected: Time doesn't correlate with mastery
   - Could advance unprepared students

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Accommodates all skill levels from beginner to advanced
- Maintains appropriate challenge level for sustained engagement
- Provides clear progression milestones for motivation
- Data-driven approach optimizes learning outcomes
- Supports long-term musical development

### Negative:
- Complex algorithm requires extensive testing and tuning
- May create frustration if advancement feels too slow
- Requires significant content development across all levels
- Potential for students to "game" the system
- More complex user interface and progress tracking

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Extensive beta testing with diverse user groups
- Optional "challenge mode" for users who want to skip ahead
- Clear explanation of progression criteria to users
- Regular algorithm refinement based on usage data
- Escape hatches for users stuck at particular levels

## Technical Requirements

### Data Collection:
- Response time tracking for speed bonuses
- Error pattern analysis for targeted remediation  
- Session length and frequency monitoring
- Long-term retention testing

### Algorithm Components:
- Statistical confidence calculations for advancement
- Plateau detection and intervention triggers
- Content recommendation engine
- Performance prediction modeling

### User Experience:
- Clear progress visualization
- Achievement system tied to level advancement
- Optional difficulty override for experienced users
- Detailed progress reports and analytics

## Success Metrics

- **Retention Rate**: Students continue using app beyond initial sessions
- **Progression Rate**: Average time to advance between levels
- **Skill Transfer**: Performance on untrained chord types/keys
- **User Satisfaction**: Survey responses on difficulty appropriateness
- **Long-term Outcomes**: Musical skill development over months
